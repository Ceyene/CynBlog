# My third post

This is my third post in this blog, so... Hello for the third time!
See my other blog and posts and follow me on social media.

Also, see an example of my code here:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
